A value of -1 indicates that the assignment file was found but
contained invalid content.

The <span style="background-color: LightCoral">light coral</span>
line is the default system; it is what you should get if you run
the code that was provided for you.  The row highlighted
with <span style="background-color: PaleGoldenRod">pale golden
  rod</span> is the baseline you should strive to beat.  Typically,
this line depicts the effort required to earn a B on the project.
Additional points will be rewarded for beating the baseline by 
a significant amount, and the most points will be awarded for placing
at or near the top of the rankings.

The <span style="background-color: LimeGreen">oracle
system</span> is a metric-aware composite of the best results
from each student submission.  It is not possible to beat the
oracle, but it gives you an idea of how much improvement there
is for your system to find.
