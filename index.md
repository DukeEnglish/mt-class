#### Course Description

[Google translate](http://translate.google.com/) instantly
translates between any pair of over eighty human languages 
like French and English. How does it do that? Why does it 
make the errors that it does? And how can you build something 
better? Modern translation systems like Google Translate, 
*learn* to translate by reading millions of words of already 
translated text. This course will show you how they work. 
We cover fundamental building blocks from machine learning, 
computer science, and linguistics, showing how they 
apply to a real and difficult problem in artificial intelligence.

#### Textbook

There is no required textbook. The course will draw on recent literature
from this fast-moving field. However, some background will be drawn from
the following books.

- [Statistical Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/book/) 
  (<a href="http://statmt.org/book/errata.html">errata</a>) 
  by [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/). Available in 
  hardcopy and electronically from the University library.
- [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. Available online.
- [Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00493ED1V01Y201303HLT020) 
  by Emily Bender. Available electronically from the university library.


#### Assessment

Three practical assignments, each worth 1/3 of the overall course marks. Due 9 Feb, 13 March, and 13 April.

The course will follow the school-wide [late coursework policy](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests)
and [academic conduct policy](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct).


#### Prerequisites

The course assumes you have taken <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/anlp/">ANLP</a> or equivalent. Machine translation applies concepts from computer science, statistics, and linguistics. You needn't be an expert in all three of these fields (few people are), but if you are allergic to any of them you should not take this course. Concretely, you will be expected to already understand the following topics before taking the course, or be prepared to learn them independently. 

- Discrete mathematics: analysis of algorithms, dynamic programming, basic graph algorithms, finite and pushdown automata.
- Other essential maths: basic probability theory; basic calculus and linear algebra; ability to read and manipulate mathematical notation including sums, products, log, and exp. 
- Programming: ability to read and modify python programs; ability to design and implement a function based on high-level description such as pseudocode or a precise mathematical statement of what the function computes.
- Linguistics: basic elements of linguistic description.
