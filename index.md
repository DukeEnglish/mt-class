Machine Translation (2014)
==========================

[Google translate](https://translate.google.com/) instantly 
translates between any pair of over eighty human languages like French and 
English. How does it do that? Why does it make the errors that it does? And 
how can you build something better? Modern translation systems like Google 
Translate, [Bing Translator](http://www.bing.com/translator/), 
and [SDL FreeTranslation](http://www.freetranslation.com/)
*learn* to translate by reading millions of words of already translated text. 
This course will show you how they work. We cover fundamental building 
blocks from linguistics, machine learning, algorithms, data structures, 
and formal language theory, showing how they apply to a difficult real-word 
artificial intelligence problem.
