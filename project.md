You will design a final project by yourself or with one or two other
students with guidance from us. Your project must clearly define a problem
and experimental procedure with input, output, and evaluation measures. We
are happy to discuss project ideas with you. Just make an appointment.

In the first five weeks of class you should turn in a project proposal
identifying your concrete plan. **The proposal is worth 10 points**. It 
must clearly identify:

* A single problem related to machine translation. Your problem should
be illustrated with an example and stated formally, ideally in the first
paragraph.

* An outline of your project. How will you solve the problem? What models 
and algorithms will you implement? What software will you use? 

* An experimental design. How will you know if you solved the problem?
You should clearly identify input, output, and evaluation measures.

The proposal is a contract. If we give you full credit for it, we expect
you to implement it and analyze the results, and we will give you full 
credit for the entire project if you do. If you turn in a weak proposal, 
you can revise it and resubmit it before moving forward. But the longer you 
take to define your project, the less time you will have to implement it, so
do the best you can for this early checkpoint.

Groups of any size are permitted. We will require an amount of work 
that is linear in group size, so you should take into account the overhead 
of group coordination when forming groups. Each group should turn in a single 
proposal identifying all members. All group members will receive the same grade, 
and you are stuck with your group members once your proposal is finalized: we 
refuse to adjudicate stories about who did or did not contribute.
