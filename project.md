Final Project
=============

You will design a final research project by yourself or with one or two other
students with guidance from us. You have two options: a survey option and an 
empirical option. Survey projects must clearly analyze and synthesize a selection
of recent literature a topic related to machine translation. Empirical studies 
must clearly define a research problem and an experimental procedure with 
input, output, and evaluation measures. You should make an appointment with
the instructors to discuss your project prior to the first due date. To
keep you on track, there are three:

* April 1: Project proposals (10 points)
* April 22: Interim report (5 points)
* May 9: Final project presentation (5 points)
* May 14: Final project report (10 points)

All projects will include a final written report.

Project Proposal
----------------
Your project proposal must identify a concrete research plan. A survey
proposal must clearly identify:

* A coherent research area related to machine translation. The research
area could be organized around a specific application, a technical 
problem, or a coherent set of methods for solving problems. The area
should be one that has not been surveyed before, or at least not 
recently.

* A set of initial papers to be surveyed.

* An outline of the themes that you expect to find, and questions that
you hope to learn answers to.

An empirical proposal must clearly idenfity:

* A single problem related to machine translation. Your problem should
be illustrated with an example and stated formally, ideally in the first
paragraph.

* An outline of your project. How will you solve the problem? What models 
and algorithms will you implement? What software will you use? 

* An experimental design. How will you know if you solved the problem?
You should clearly identify input, output, and evaluation measures.

The proposal is a contract. If we give you full credit for it, we expect
you to implement it and analyze the results, and we will give you full 
credit for the entire project if you do. If you turn in a weak proposal, 
you can revise it and resubmit it before moving forward. But the longer you 
take to define your project, the less time you will have to implement it, so
do the best you can for this early checkpoint.

Interim Report
--------------

By the time of the interim report, you should have made substantial progress
on your report. For a survey, you should have read many of the papers,
identified main themes of the literature, and drafted a rough organizational
outline. For an empirical project, you should have collected data, developed
baseline algorithms and metrics, and run preliminary experiments.


Project Ideas
-------------

Many topics related to machine translation are welcome. Some suggestions:

* Translation models that incorporate morphology, syntax, or semantics.
* Translation of social media text.
* Translation of speech.
* Translation of data different from available training data, such as medical texts.
* Pushing further on one of the homeworks, say by incorporating more advanced techniques and more
  data.
* [Writing your own MT class assignment](http://mt-class.org/penn/project.html)
* Principled methods for incorporating non-parallel data 
  (e.g., dictionaries, grammars, or thesauri) into translation models.
* Rule-based translation (e.g., from manually-developed rules)
* GPU algorithms for translation. 
* Learning translation dictionaries without parallel data.
* Interactive machine translation that assists human translators.
* Crowdsourcing methods for machine translation.
* Machine learning techniques for translation: neural networks, Bayesian models, etc.
* Advanced decoding algorithms.
* Models for translation evaluation.
* Post-processing MT output (e.g., applying correct capitalization, removing unnecessary spaces,
  combining compounds)

Group Work
----------
Groups of any size are permitted. We will require an amount of work 
that is linear in group size, so you should take into account the overhead 
of group coordination when forming groups. Each group should turn in a single 
proposal identifying all members. All group members will receive the same grade, 
and you are stuck with your group members once your proposal is finalized: we 
refuse to adjudicate stories about who did or did not contribute.
