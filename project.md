title: Final Project
---

The final project will
be designed by the student or groups of students, with guidance from the 
instructors. As with the homework assignments, it should be on well-defined 
problem with clearly identified input, output, and evalution, and executed 
with creativity and depth.

Early in the term you will be required to turn in a brief
project proposal (10 points), laying out the problem, your proposed solution, and a
plan for implementation and evaluation. Your final project report (20 points) should explain 
your implementation, evaluation, and analysis, focusing on a single question:
What did you learn? The projects will be presented during an interactive poster
session during the final exam period (10 points).

The project proposal should be 1-2 pages (there is no hard limit, but it 
will take us longer to give you feedback if your proposal is long or 
unclear) and must clearly identify:

* A single question or problem related to machine translation. This should be 
stated in the first paragraph. We strongly advise including some simple examples 
to illustrate the question or problem.
* An outline of the work to be done: how will your project answer the question 
or attempt to solve the problem? What models and algorithms will you implement? 
What software will you use?
* A description of planned experiments: how will you know if the question was 
answered or the problem was solved? You should clearly identify input, output, 
and evaluation strategy.

The proposal is a contract. If we give you full credit for it, that means 
we expect you to implement it and do a good analysis of the results, and we 
will give you full credit for the entire project if you do. If you turn in a 
weak proposal, we will give you the opportunity to submit a revised one before 
moving forward, but the longer you take to define your project, the less time 
you will have to implement it, so it's in your best interest to take advantage 
of this early checkpoint.

Before the proposal is due, you should make an appointment with one of the 
instructors in order to discuss project ideas; this will enable you to submit 
a proposal with full confidence that it will be well-received. Before meeting 
with us, you might want to browse over topics that we'll be covering later in 
the term, since these might suggest ideas to you. We will however give you 
fairly wide latitude to choose a topic as long as it's related in some way to 
translation and is technically interesting, so you should not feel restricted to 
these topics. We can suggest topics to you in individual meetings if you're 
stumped, but it will help us to know what your interests and strengths are, so 
be prepared to tell us what you're curious about.

Groups projects of any size are permitted, but we will require an amount of 
work that is linear in group size, so you should take into account the overhead 
of group coordination when forming groups. Each group should turn in a single 
proposal identifying all members. All group members will receive the same grade, 
and you are stuck with your group members once your proposal is finalized: we 
refuse to adjudicate stories about who did or did not contribute. Choose your 
partners carefully.
